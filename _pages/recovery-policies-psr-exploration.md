<!-- As part of this publication, we release the [`gplanetary_nav`](https://github.com/utiasSTARS/gplanetary-nav) Python library, an open-source repository to facilitate the interface between orbital data and global navigation planning algorithms in support of long-range/strategic planetary mobility. -->

## Overview

<figcaption>With a solar-powered rover affected by random navigation delays, the safest way out of a PSR is dictated by the probability of survival of the rover, not the physically shortest path. Impact of faults on the safety of a solar-powered rover exiting a PSR. In subfigure A, the dashed line shows the path generated by a hypothetical risk-agnostic offline spatiotemporal planner. The blue arrow shows an action returned by a hypothetical online, risk-aware planner. A fault occurring early into the traverse (subfigure B) not only invalidates the offline plan, but in this case it also prevents the rover from being exposed to sunlight no matter where it exits the PSR (subfigure C). On the other hand, a risk-aware online planner can, by design, proactively account for stochastic faults (see blue path). In this conceptual example, the online planning methodology leads the rover to sunlight (subfigure D). Background image courtesy of NASA and Arizona State University.

## Supplementary material: animation of recovery drives from the LCROSS crash site

The manuscript shows snapshots of simulation trials departing at different times from a specific location near the LCROSS crash site. The following shows complete animations of these traverses:
