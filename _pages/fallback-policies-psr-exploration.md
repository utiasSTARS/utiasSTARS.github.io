# Fallback Policies for the Exploration of Lunar Permanently Shadowed Regions by a Solar-Powered Rover
**Article currently under review to appear in the Acta Astronautica journal.**

As part of this publication, we release the [`gplanetary_nav`](https://github.com/utiasSTARS/global-planetary-nav) Python library, an open-source repository to facilitate the interface between orbital data and global navigation planning algorithms in support of long-range/strategic planetary mobility.

<figcaption>With a solar-powered rover affected by random navigation delays, the safest way out of a PSR is dictated by the probability of survival of the rover, not the physically shortest path. In the above example, the shortest path outside of the PSR is not resilient against delays, which will cause the rover to miss a crucial solar charging time window.</figcaption>

## Supplementary material: simulated exits from PSRs in the Cabeus, Faustini and Shoemaker regions at the lunar south pole

Supplementary experiments in progress and results will be shared here.
